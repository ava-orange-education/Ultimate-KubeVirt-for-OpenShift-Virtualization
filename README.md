## About the Book
KubeVirt brings virtualization directly into Kubernetes and OpenShift environments. With KubeVirt, enterprises can run legacy applications alongside microservices on a single, consistent platform, eliminating the inefficiencies of maintaining parallel infrastructures.

Ultimate KubeVirt for OpenShift Virtualization is your comprehensive guide to mastering this powerful technology within OpenShift Virtualization. In this book, you will begin by understanding why KubeVirt matters in today’s hybrid cloud landscape, and how it fits within the broader Kubernetes ecosystem. From there, the book walks you through environment setup, architecture fundamentals, and hands-on VM management.

You will also dive into essential topics like networking, persistent storage, and security—ensuring your workloads are production-ready. As you progress, advanced chapters guide you through GitOps automation, performance monitoring, and comparing KubeVirt with tools such as vCluster. Further, you will explore use cases like Golden VM images with the CDI project, hybrid/multi-cloud deployments, and future-focused features such as GPU passthrough and high availability.

Hence, whether you are a Kubernetes administrator, DevOps engineer, or Cloud architect, this book equips you to design, deploy, and scale virtual machines, the Kubernetes-native way!

So, start building the future of virtualization—one cluster at a time.
